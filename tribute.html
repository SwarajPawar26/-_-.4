                <h4> Changing the Lives of the Madia-Gond Tribal People</h4><br> This doctor couple uplifted the lives
                of the Madia-Gond tribal community to an unthought-of level. The selfless work of this couple brought
                them into the mainstream and in the process several engineers, doctors and teachers were nurtured by the
                duo. In the initial days, the doctor duo began treating the tribes people in a makeshift hospital,
                taught the kids beneath a tree and helped to reduce the day-to-day problems of the tribal people in the
                area. Their efforts for development of the region has borne rich fruits today with the establishment of
                a hospital fitted with modern facilities,a residential school reaching out to hundreds of tribal
                children and the development of the ‘Animal Ark’.<br><br>

                immeasurable contribution to society proving a source of inspiration to all of us. His immense work was
                recognized globally when he and his wife were awarded the Magsaysay Award for ‘Community Leadership’ in
                2008. They were honored with several other awards too; however, this totally down-to-earth couple
